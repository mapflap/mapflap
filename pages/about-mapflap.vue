          The Name
          <p class="snippet">
            Map flap, what does it mean? The origin of the name of this little project comes from two main reasons. The
            first one, I must be honest, is because it sounds really good. It seems that those two words were
            invented to be used together, isn't it? The second reason why (more serious, I promise) is because of my
            passion, I am a Geoinformatics Engineer and I am interested in all the technologies that help humans to locate themselves
            and things on the Earth (Elon, let me know when I can also add Mars).
            The main idea of this project is to build piece by piece a little digital world to show off my passion.

        <p class="snippet">
          The aim of this project, as said, is to build a little digital world to show which is my passion. More
          concretely, I will use Mapflap to share some little works and experiments with any interested human, animal or
          martian (the latter depends again on you Elon) equipped with an internet connection. Have fun and thanks for
          dropping by. ðŸ‘¾
